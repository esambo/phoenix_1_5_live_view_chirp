# Chirp
A Twitter timeline clone from scratch using Phoenix LiveView.
Based on [Build a real-time Twitter clone in 15 minutes with LiveView and Phoenix 1.5](https://www.phoenixframework.org/blog/build-a-real-time-twitter-clone-in-15-minutes-with-live-view-and-phoenix-1-5)

The goal is to show:
- how great LiveView is to build interactive applications
- not having to write any JavaScript to make it happen
- the amount of data on the wire will be more efficient than the best single page app you could write by hand

## Setup

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Setup the project with `bin/setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
